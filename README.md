Hi there! You found my webpage! This is Qiyao (chi-yao), a University of Toronto undergrad inspired by the advances and accomplishments of Artificial Intelligence. My short-term research interest is to make AI more about theory and justification, rather than network design and hyperparameter tuning. My long-term goal is to crack the code of human intelligence, or to achieve human-level intelligence in our machines.

## Publications

- Here is a technical report on mirror descent, Bregman Divergences, and an analysis on Krichene and Bartlett (2017)
- Epidemic Control with Reinforcement Learning, only single-node for now

## Favorite Readings
This is where I put some of the articles or papers I read, and will recommend to others. Specifically, they will either convey some inspiration that I could not have summarized better, or illustrated a theory very clearly

- Ever wondered where all the reparametrization in Stochastic Variational Inference came from? http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/10/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-4-reparameterisation-tricks/
- In my opinion, the epitome of combining theory and practice: how machine learning should be done. Variational Bayes (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)

## Favorite quotes
This is where I record some of the best (i.e. pithy but elucidating) words I came across. For a total stranger, they will require context to make sense. I always welcome discussions of stuff like this.

- "Why does the wind blow?" "Because the leaves move" ---Yann LeCun interview with Lex Fridman
- E.T.Jaynes page 103 "how we solve a problem when it becomes to difficult"

## Miscellaneous
There are also beautiful words that are not AI related.

- The Great Gatsby and his "extraordinary gift of hope"
