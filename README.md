Hi there! You found my webpage! This is Qiyao (chi-yao), a University of Toronto undergrad inspired by the advances and accomplishments of Artificial Intelligence. My short-term research interest is to make AI more about theory and justification, rather than network design and hyperparameter tuning. My long-term goal is to crack the code of human intelligence, or to achieve human-level intelligence in our machines.

## Publications and Presentations

- [Here](https://github.com/QiyaoWei/wqy.github.io/blob/master/Qiyao's%20Mirror%20Descent%20Report.pdf) is a technical report on mirror descent, Bregman Divergences, and an analysis on Krichene and Bartlett (2017). [Here](https://github.com/QiyaoWei/website/blob/master/Mirror_Descent_Presentation.pdf) is a presentation I gave to Professor Yinyu Ye at Stanford on this paper.
- Epidemic Control with Reinforcement Learning, only single-node for [now](https://github.com/QiyaoWei/wqy.github.io/blob/master/Epidemic_Control_with_Reinforcement_Learning_Project_Report.pdf). [Here](https://github.com/QiyaoWei/website/blob/master/RLpres.pdf) is a presentation I gave to our research group at Vector.

## Favorite Readings
This is where I put some of the articles or papers I read, and will recommend to others. Specifically, they will either convey some inspiration that I could not have summarized better, or illustrated a theory very clearly

- Ever wondered where all the reparametrization in Stochastic Variational Inference came [from?](http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/10/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-4-reparameterisation-tricks/)
- In my opinion, the epitome of combining theory and practice: how machine learning should be done. [Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)
- Cute papers. [Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf), [Rank AE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00679.pdf), [ReLU bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381.pdf)

## Favorite quotes
This is where I record some of the best (i.e. pithy but elucidating) words I came across. For a total stranger, they will require context to make sense. I always welcome discussions of stuff like this.

- "Why does the wind blow?" "Because the leaves move" ---Yann LeCun interview with Lex Fridman
- E.T.Jaynes page 103 "how we solve a problem when it becomes to difficult"
- Von Neumann "You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, nobody knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage"

## Miscellaneous
There are also beautiful words that are not AI related.

- The Great Gatsby and his "extraordinary gift of hope"

## What if I am just getting started?

- [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00019.pdf) is a nice introductory paper about MLPs and RNNs
- [Here](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) is my favorite deep reinforcement learning course. A word of caution about videos---come to them with questions and learning will go smoothly, if watched without active learning then not much can be recalled
