### Qiyao Wei

Hi there! You found my webpage! This is Qiyao (chi-yao), an undergrad inspired by the advances and accomplishments of Artificial Intelligence. My short-term research interest is to make AI more about theory and justification, not about network design and hyperparameter tuning. My long-term goal is to crack the code of human intelligence, or to achieve human-level intelligence in our machines.

## Projects

## Favorite Readings
This is where I put some of the articles or papers I read, and will recommend to others. Specifically, they will either convey some inspiration that I could not have summarized, or illustrated a theory very clearly

- Ever wondered where all the one-liners in Stochastic Variational Inference came from?
- In my opinion, the epitome of combining theory and practice: how machine learning should be done

## Favorite quotes
This is where I record some of the best (ie pithy but elucidating) words I came across.

- "Why does the wind blow?" "Because the leaves move" ---Yann LeCun interview with Lex Fridman
- ETJaynes

## Miscellaneous
There are also beautiful words that are not AI related.
